# Luma3DS
*Noob-proof (N)3DS "Custom Firmware"*

## Why did I create this fork?
Well, I saw GitHub User [DullPointer](https://github.com/DullPointer) made a fork of Luma3DS From the Luma Team with some extra cool features, but it was missing commits from the Luma3DS Development Team, so I decided to merge those into this! If i figure out how 3DS Modding works, I might update this fork with some cool stuff. For now this has no support and ***I will not provide any support for ANYONE running this fork, nor will the Luma3DS Team. Use at your own risk!***

### What it is
**Luma3DS** is a program to patch the system software of (New) Nintendo (2)3DS handheld consoles "on the fly", adding features such as per-game language settings, debugging capabilities for developers, and removing restrictions enforced by Nintendo such as the region lock.

It also allows you to run unauthorized ("homebrew") content by removing signature checks.
To use it, you will need a console capable of running homebrew software on the Arm9 processor.

Since v8.0, Luma3DS has its own in-game menu, triggerable by <kbd>L+Down+Select</kbd> (see the [release notes](https://github.com/LumaTeam/Luma3DS/releases/tag/v8.0)).
